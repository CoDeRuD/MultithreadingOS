# Dining Philosophers Multithreading Concept for OS

## Why this Program was created, and a little about what it does
###### This project was completed for an Operating Systems class I had recently taken while in school. Thread functions such as pthread_create() and pthread_join() are used to create threads based of a thread routine that perform a set of actions, and then are joined together. Mutex objects declared as globals exclusively and used by the child threads to access resources independently.
